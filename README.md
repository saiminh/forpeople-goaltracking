# forpeople goal tracker webapp

This is a webapp for tracking goals. The main goal is to provide a extremely easy way for HR to update individual goals of team members via a Google Sheet. 

The webapp is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and the data of the Google Sheet is fetched using [Opensheet](https://github.com/benborgers/opensheet).
